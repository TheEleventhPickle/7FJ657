<!--
This time, let's look at Images.

First of all, look at how IDs and classes are distinctly separate from each other.
We have a header (<h3>) tag with an ID of "walrus," and a div with the class of walrus.

In our CSS, we've styled them differently.  The header is brown, and the div is colored green.

----------

We've also included an image in this page.  Images are "self-closing," which, once again means
that there is no </img>.

Like <a> links, images have a "href" attribute that points to where the image is on the internet.

On our img, I've also added a class called "walrus-image."  Can you find where I put the styles for that one?

---------

In CSS, anything can have a width and height.  These dimensions are measured in pixels, which are very tiny
squares of light on your screen.  In CSS, pixels are abbreviated at "px."

Images have special powers in HTML in that you can set their height to "auto."  When you do this, the browser
will adjust the height so that the image looks correct.
