<!--
In CSS, you tell it to target something with a class
named "container" putting a dot in front of it.

.container {
  color: blue;
  font-weight: bold;
}

For instance, if you delete the dot, nothing gets styled. Try it!

------------

CSS can also target HTML tags in general.

Here, we target every h1 on the page.  Notice that there is no
dot before this (or anything else).

h1 {
  color: red;
}

------------

Finally, CSS can target ID's.  An ID is used for items that
only appear once on a page.  These should never get reused.

<h1 id="our-custom-title">This is a header</h1>

Notice in the CSS, an id has a # before it:

#our-custom-title {
  text-decoration: underline;
}

------------

This is another example of styling something with a class.

.container-two {
  padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}


Here's something interesting to try:  You can have more than one
class on a tag.  When you do this, it takes the styles for both of them
and combines them on the same element.

Give it a shot!  Try adding "container-two" to the "container" div and see what happens.

It should look like this.
<div class="container container-two">

Note that you cannot combine IDs.

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

  <head>
    <title>Lesson 2</title>
  </head>

  <!-- This is CSS. Note that it uses the <style> tag -->
  <style>
    .container {
      color: blue;
      font-weight: bold;
    }

    .container-two {
      padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px;
      border: 1px solid black;
    }

    h1 {
      color: red;
    }

    #our-custom-title {
      text-decoration: underline;
    }
  </style>

  <body>
    <h1 id="our-custom-title">Lesson 2: CSS Styles</h1>

    <div class="container">
      <p>This is a paragraph tag.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-two">
      <p> This is a <a href="http://google.com">Link</a>.</p>
    </div>
