<!--
This is a basic example of what HTML looks like.

The things within the <>s are called Elements, or more commonly, tags.
Nearly all of them must have a closing </> tag, like if you look at the <title></title> above.

Things between the opening and closing tag are "inside" of them.  For instance,
the <title> is inside of the <head> tags.


Notice how things are indented.
The <html> and </html> are lined up, as well as the HEAD and BODY tags.
This isn't mandatory, but it's the way everyone does it.  It keeps things nice
and neat in your code so things are easy for you to find later.

---- A look at the document ----

<!DOCTYPE html>
This tells the browser that it's looking at an html file type.  It doesn't have a closing tag
( </!DOCTYPE> doesn't exist )


<html></html>
This is mandatory.  Notice the closing tag at the end of the document.


<head></head>
This is mandatory, and contains scripts and styles, like .js and .css files.  These things aren't visible to site visitors.

<title></title>
This sets the label that goes in the browser tab.  Not mandatory, but very important.


<body></body>
This contains the content that people will see.  This is mandatory


<div></div>
These are major divisions in the content.  They are generic containers, so they're very common.

You'll notice that the divs above have classes.  Classes are custom labels we can name just about anything in HTML.
These labels are used to tell CSS and Javascript what to modify.

Classes can go on just about anything inside the BODY, including the BODY itself.
They're used to tell the CSS styles what to color or how to position things.

Like, we might tell it to make the DIV with the class "container" blue text,
and then "container-two" can have red text.  This way the whole page won't have
blue text.


<h1></h1>
These header tags come in several sizes: h1, h2, h3, h4, with h1 being the biggest and most important, down to even an h6, which is dinky and pretty much useless.


<p></p>
This tells the browser that this is a paragraph.


<a href=""></a>
This is a link, and the "a" stands for "anchor," but everyone still calls it a link tag.
This has a "href" attribute where you put the URL of the place you want it to go when
the user clicks it.

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Lesson 1</title>

  <body>
    <h1>Lesson 1: Elements (This is a header)</h1>

    <div class="container">
      <p>This is a paragraph tag.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-two">
      <p> This is a <a href="http://google.com">Link</a>.</p>
    </div>
