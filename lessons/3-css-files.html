<!--
You can make separate files for your CSS, which is really handy
because it keeps your html file nice and neat.

Tag we use to link to the CSS file. It's a <link>.

Even though it's a link tag, don't mistake these for <a></a> tags.

See how it doesn't have a </link> after it.  This is called a
"self-closing" tag.  There are a few of these, but generally, tags are
paired with closing tags.

----------

The "rel" attribute tells the browser that we're linking to a stylesheet.
CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets."  Basically, this means you can
have more than one file that can give styles to your document.
Another option to put in the "rel" is "javascript," for instance.

----------

Finally, the <link> has a "href," much like an <a></a>.  This tells the
browser where the file is found.

----------

Now, go to the folder called "css" and open "3-css-files.css."

You'll see that it contains the same styles from Lesson 2, which is why
the page looks exactly the same.  If you change anything in this file, the
new styles (like a color or something) will appear the next time you reload
the page in the browser.
